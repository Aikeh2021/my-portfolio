### Introduction

A portfolio is a crucial piece of the job search process for candidates across the globe. In 2020, a portfolio is an opportunity to showcase the highest quality work a professional has crafted during their career.
While paper portfolios are still the go-to medium for many jobseekers, it’s also important to possess a digital portfolio. Now that much of the job search process has moved to online applications and portals, an online portfolio can be the difference between a completed application and one missing the piece that could set a candidate apart from thousands of other applicants.
For this assignment, I was tasked with recreating a portfolio and incorporating media queries so that recruiters can view the website on any device without missing out on any of the design elements of the website built to draw attention to the work of the candidate.

### Installation

Please click here to view the website.

If you would like to download this repository as a template for creating your own portfolio, please follow the steps listed below:

1. If you do not already have a github account, create one.
2. click this link to access the my-portfolio-fall-2020 repository.
3. Fork the repository.
    * For this, you will need permission from the author of the repository. This may take some time depending on how often the author visits their github page/whether they have notifications for their github account linked to their email. Be sure to allow yourself some time to complete your portfolio in case you are not granted permission to use the repository you desire.
4. Copy the SSH key for the repository
5. Open your terminal/gitbash application on your computer.
6. Create a directory to place the ssh key
    *Make sure you stay in this directory so you know exactly where you find the repository you're about to copy onto your device.
7. Type 'git clone' and paste the ssh key into the gitbash/terminal command line
8. Hit enter to begin the clone process.
9. Once complete, type 'code .' into the terminal/gitbash command line.
    * This will open the Visual Studio Code application on your computer. If you do not have visual studio code, I recommend installing it prior to completing step 9.
10. Now you can alter the existing code to complete the profile with the information of your choosing!

### Usage

The navigation bar feature on this website is a main component! If you would like to go back and forth between pages of the website, this feature will be heavily utilized!
Just click one of the tabs to designate where you would like to visit. 


### Style

I chose the brick patterned background because I felt it went better with the more geometric style of the website. I felt the rectangular look of city buildings also tied nicely into the industrial looking theme.
The color scheme of teal, white, and gray maintains the professional appearance one would want for a portfolio.
Though, one stylistic modification I wasn’t able to figure out was the font color on the ‘Your Name’ tab on the navigation bar. Unfortunately, the letters remain black. Ideally they would have been white to tie into the them of the webpage. I guess this will have to do for now.
